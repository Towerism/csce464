1) The selection of $w_j$ creates the proportional relationship  $r_j\propto
   w_j$. Therefore, if we normally have $\sqrt{r_j} <\sqrt{r_k}$, there is a
   constant $w_j>1$ such that $w_j\sqrt{r_j}>\sqrt{r_k}$.

   1) See Figure [[fig:30-successes]] for the first 30 successes.
   2) See Table [[tab:bonus-2]] for the results 1000 transmission attempts. To run
      the script, execute =./p1.sh=
3) 
   1) See Table [[tab:4-times]] for the powers of nodes A and C.
   2) See Figure [[fig:9-iterations]] for the result of running the distributed
      power control simulation for 9 iterations. To run the script, execute =./p3.sh=
