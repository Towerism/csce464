1) Needs to show each step of the algorithm. See tables below.
2) Straightforward. Recall the network layer discussion about dual routing.
3) Not reacting too aggressively due to errors may reduce overhead.
4) 
   1) Slow start happens when the congestion window follows an exponential-like
      curve upward. Avoidance is the linear trend upward.
   2) 
   3) 
5) After a data hiatus. Do you continue with the recently used cwd and threshold
   values, or do you go through the process of slow start all over again?

What is sshtresh? slow-start threshold
