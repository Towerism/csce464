* Wireless basics
** Design
- Physical -> data link -> network -> transport -> application
- (detect medium) -> (establish link and transmit packets to specified router)
  -> (choose best route) -> (ECC, encryption/decryption, convert to/from
  application, connection management) -> (define data to send)
** Challenges:
- Upredictable noise and interference
- Variable channel conditions
- Variable network topology
- Variabl etraffic pattern and requirements
- Spatial reuse
- Diversity
  - Each antenna may have different connection strength
  - Each user has different connection strength
** Types of networks
- Infrastructure based: routers connect to network connects to internet
- AdHoc: Devices connect to each other
- Hybrid: Devices connect to each other, connect to router, connect to network,
  connect to internet.
** Protocols
- Protocol: set of rules
- Network Architecture: set of protocols for exchange of information
- Encapsulation: Adding headers by various network layers
** Error Correction Codes
- ECC: Can detect/correct errors
- (n, k) code: k bits of data, n-k checkbits
- Hamming distance between two code words is number of bits by which they differ
- Distance of a code: minimum hamming distance between 2 code words
- (7, 4) can detect up to 2bit errors, but correct none, or correct single bit errors
- (8, 4) can detect up to 3 bit errors, but correct none, or correct single
  bit and detect 2 bit errors
** Modulation
- Pulse $b(t)$ of duration $T$
  - 0: $s_0(t)=-b(t)$
  - 1: $s_1(t)=b(t)$
- Baseband is superimposed on carrier, multiply baseband by carrier
  - $W_i(t)=A_ib(t)\cos(2\pi f_ct))$
** AWGN (Additive White Gaussian Noise)
- Additive: noise added to signal of interest
- White: noise power spectral density is flat, independent of $f$
- Process: noise at each time is a random variable
- Gaussian: noise at time $t$ is a Gaussian random variable
** Converting to decibels
- $\text{dBW}=10\log_{10}P$, $P$ is in watts 
- $\text{dBm}=10\log_{10}P$, $P$ is in milliwatts
** Transmission
- Error probability can be reduced by increasing energy per bit
- Channel capacity: best achievable rate of reliable information delivery (bps)
  - $C=W\log_2(1+\frac{P}{N_0W})$
  - $SNR = 10\log_10(\text{Signal power}/\text{Noise power})$
  - $SINR = 10\log_10(\text{Signal power}/(\text{Interference}+\text{Noise power})$
- Path gain is power received over power sent
- Path loss is the inverse of the gain
- Received power is always less than transmit power
- Large scale path loss is average channel conditions, small scale is variations
  due to fading
- Fading is caused by multiple paths or movement of objects
  - Rayleigh: Many paths from transmitter to receiver, none dominant
  - Ricean: Dominant path present, along with others
- Free space propagation: $P_r=k\frac{P_s}{d^2}$
- Two-ray ground propagation: $P_r(d)=P_r(d_0)\frac{d_0^4}{d^4}$
- Log distance propagation: $P_r(d)=P_r(d_0)\frac{d_0^a}{d^a}$
- Log-normal shadowing model: average large scale loss at $d$ plus gaussian
  random variable
- Bandwidth: measure of amount of spectrum occupied by a signal transmitted on a channel
- Capacity: maximumm possible rate of information delivery
- Transmission rate: rate at which information is transmitted on channel
- Throughput: rate at which data is reliably delivered between pairs of nodes
** Formulas To recognize
- $x(t)=\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} X(f)e^{j2\pi ft}df$
  - $x(t)$ time domain
  - $X(f)$ frequency domain, it is also the Fourier transform of $x(t)$
  - $e^{j2\pi ft}$ conversion factor
- $E_x=\int_{t_1}^{t_2}\|x(t)\|^2dt$
  - Energy content of $x(t)$ (the time domain)
- $P_x=\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}S_x(f)$
  - $S_x$ power spectral density
* Distributed Medium access control
** Performance
- Depends on
  - Channel properties
  - Physical capabilities
    - Single interface
    - One packet at a time
    - One channel at a time
    - Antenna diversity
** Protocols
*** Centralized
- A designated host is responsible for coordinating access
- Not of immediate interest to us
*** Distributed
- No single host responsible for access
**** Coordinated access
- Each host is somehow "scheduled" to transmit in certain intervals of time
- Schedule chosen to avoid excessive interference between simultaneous transmissions
**** Random access
- Each host "randomly" decides when to transmit
**** "Basic" Medium Access Control (MAC)
- Based on Aloha: transmit: transmit packet immediately (if not trnasmitting
  another packet already)
- Cons
  - No provision for reliability
  - No detection of collisions
- Window of vulnerability is $2L$ where $L$ is the size of a slot
**** Slotted Aloha
- Synchronized slot boundaries decreases vulnerability to $1L$
- With propgation delay $\leq \tau$, slot size $L+\tau$ to ensure vulnerability
  of 1 slot
- With clock skew $\leq \mu$, slot size $L + \tau+\mu$ to ensure window of
  vulnerability of 1 slot
***** Performance
- Assuming $n$ slots
- When $n\rightarrow\infty$ optimal throughput approaches $1/e=0.36
- Compare this to unslotted where optimal throughput approaches $1/(2e)$
**** Carrier Sensing
***** Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA)
- Listen before you talk
- A host may transmit only if the channel is sensed as idle
***** Endergy detection
- Potential implementation
  - Sample the signal periodically
  - Sum the square of the sampled values
  - If sum exceeds a threshold, signal present
- Requires non-zero delay to correctly sense the channel status
- Another possibility
  - Detect transition from idle to busy, and vice-versa, instead of presence of
    a signal
****** Approximation
- Implementation using Carrier Sense Threshold (PCS)
- If received power $<$ CS threshold $\rightarrow$ Channel idle
- Else channel busy
****** Cons
- accuracy also affected by noise and interference
- Non-determistic due to presence of noise
***** Trade-off
- Large carrier sense threshold
  - More transmitters
  - Greater spatial reuse and more interference
***** Impact of CS Threshold on Interference
- $P_tg_{AC}\leq P_{CS} \Rightarrow P_t\leq\frac{P_{CS}}{g_{AC}}$
- Interference $I_{CB}=P_tg_{CB}\leq\frac{P_{CS}}{g_{AC}}g_{CB}=P_{CS}\frac{g_{CB}}{g_{AC}}$
***** Feature Detection
- Detect a "well-known" waveform to know if a transmission is taking place
  - Preamble
- Trade-off between complexity and accuracy of sensing with energy detection and
  feature detection
**** Hidden Terminal
- Collisions may occur despite carrier sensing
- Smaller carrier sensing can help but increases the incidence of exposed terminals
- Cannot eliminate all collisions using carrier sensing
- Trade-off between hidden and exposed terminals
**** Collision Detection
***** Ethernet
- Ethernet uses carrier sensing and collision detection (CSMA/CD)
- Transmitter also listens to the channel
- M.is match between transmitted and received signal indicates mismatch
- Stop transmitting immediately once collision is detected, reduces the loss on
  a collision
***** Wireless
- Receiving while transmitting: received signal dominated by transmitted singal
- Collision occurs at receiver, not the transmitter
- Collision detection difficult at the transmitter without feedback from the receiver
**** Collision Avoidance
- Use mechanism to reduce occurence of collisions
- For collision to occur, transmissions musts overlap in time
- Two types of overlapping transmissions:
  - Simultaneous
  - Concurrent
    - Overlapping transmissions, which are not simultaneous, are said to be _concurrent_
***** Parameter $\delta$
- Worst case propgation delay $\tau$
- Worst case carrier sensing delay $\sigma$
- $\delta=\tau+\sigma$
***** Concurrent Transmissions
- Simultaneous and concurrent transmissions desirable if they do not cause too
  much interference to ongoing transmissions
  - Trade off between spatial reuse and intelligence
**** Reliability
- Forward error correction and re-transmit
- Retransmission protocol (stop and wait)
  - Send packet
  - Start timeout interval, and
  - Wait for ACK
  - If no ACK within timeout interval, retransmit
- Overhead of collisions is function of cost of collisions and frequency of collisions
**** Control packets
- RTS - Duration of proposed transmission specified
- CTS - Acknowledge receipt of RTS
- Other hosts overhearing RTS keep quiet for duration of proposed transmission
- Better to use RTS-CTS if data packets are large and collisions are frequent
- It reduces collision cost due to simultaneous transmissions
- If data packets are too small, sending RTS-CTS is not beneficial
  - So send RTS-CTS only for data packets with size $>$ RTS-threshold
**** Solutions for hidden terminals
- Busy tone
- Virtual Carrier sensing (RTS/CTS)
  - Between a pair of hosts $A$ and $B$
  - Host $B$ transmit busy-tone while receiving the data
  - Other hosts defer transmission if received busy-tone power exceeds threshold $P_{CS}$
  - However, if $C$ transmits even though $B$ is sending $A$ busy tone, then
    - $P_tg_{BC}\leq P_{CS}$
  - Sensing threshold from busy-tone P_{CS} threshold is a good bound on the interference
    which can be controlled by manipulating the P_{CS} threshold.
***** Issues
- Overhead of spectrum used from busy-tone
- Differences in channel gain of data and busytone channel
* Virtual Carrier Sensing (RTS/CTS)
** Basic RTS/CTS
- RTS specifies duration of transmission
  - Sent by the Sender
- CTS also includes the duration
  - Sent by the Receiver
- Any host hearing RTS or CTS will stay silent
- A third node may not receive RTS and still cause collision with Ack reception
  at the sender.
- Assume SINR-threshold model
- SINR $\beta$ necessary for reliable delivery
- SINR for RTS reception at a third node $C$ is upper bounded as $SINR_C\leq P_tg_{AC}/N$
- If $C$ transmits while $A$ is receiving an Ack from $B$, $SINR$ for Ack
  reception at $A$ is upper bounded as $SINR_A\leq\frac{P_tg_{BA}}{P_tg_{CA}+N}$
** Modification
- Greater protection form interference
- Reduce book-keeping with multiple nearby transmitters
- For a third node which hears all of RTS, CTS and Ack, in addition for being
  silent for the duration of the CTS and Ack packets, it will also be silent for
  the duration of data.
- For a node which is a hidden terminal and does not hear the RTS packet, but
  rather only hears the CTS and Ack packets, will now not only remain silent for
  the duration of data but also the duration of Ack.
** Physical and Virtual CS
- PCS and VCS can be used simultaneously
- Channel assumed idle ony if _both_ PCS and VS indicate that the channel is
  idle
** p-Persistence
- Carrier Sense does not eliminate collisions altogether (e.g. simultaneous transmission)
- *A mechanism is needed to reduce collision probability*
- A dialog may consist of
  - Data
  - Data-Ack
  - RTS-CTS-Data-Ack
- Dialog begins at a valid transmission opportunity. With physical carrier
  sense, we need to define this further.
- Recall: slotted access used slot size = packet size
- Therefore minimize packet size (this still can't prevent two nodes from
  transmitting simultaneously)
- At each _valid_ transmission opportunity, a host may attempt to transmit a
  packet only with probability $p$.
- Slot size $\delta=\tau+\sigma$
  - Recall:
    - $\tau$ is propagation delay
    - $\sigma$ is carrier sense delay
- Back-of-the-envelope analysis
  - Consider $n$ nodes that can sense each other
  - $p$ = access probability for each slot
    - $P_{success}=np(1-p)^{n-1}$
    - $P_{none}=(1-p)^n$
    - $P_{collision}=1-P_{success}-P_{none}$
- Duration required for a transmission or collision:
  - Data length + slot size ($L+\delta$)
  - $L+\tau+\sigma$
- Efficiency of channel access (the fraction of time, for which data is
  transmitted reliably):
  - $\frac{P_{success}L}{P_{none}\delta+(1-P_{none})(L+\delta)}=\frac{P_{success}L}{\delta+(1-P_{none})L}$
** Backoff Intervals
- Skip a bounded number of valid opportunities before transmitting a packet
- Initialize a counter by a backoff interval chosen uniformaly in range [Bmin, Bmax]
- Decrement counter after each slot in which channel is idle
- Transmit on a valid opportunity if counter is 0
** Responding to packet loss
- Packet loss may occur from simultaneous or concurrent transmission for example
- Reduce simultaneous transmission by reducing access probability
- Achieve this by increasing the range of the backoff interval
- E.g. exponential backoff $[0, cw-1]\rightarrow[0, 2cw-1]$ (for contention
  window $cw$)
- A large $cw$ leads to larger overhead
- A small $cw$ leads to more collisions
* IEEE 802.11
** Implementation
- Check medium
- If medium free for IFS, send data
- If medium busy, wait for free IFS, start a countdown for random back off
- If medium occupied during backoff, pause backoff
** Terms
- Station: terminal with access mechanisms to the wireless medium and radio
  contact to the access point
- Basic Service Set: Group of stations using the same radio frequency
- Access point: station integrated in the the wireless LAN and the distribution system
- Portal: bridge to other (wired) networks
- Distribution system: interconnection network to form on logical network based
  on several BSS
- Channels: 11 in US, 13 in Europe, 14 in Japan
** Distributed Coordination Function (DCF)
- PCS and VCS (RTS-CTS)
- Contention window ($cw$): backoff chosen uniformly $[0,cw-1]$
- Exponential backoff after a packet loss
- Contention window reset to $CW_{min}$ on a successful transmission
** Priorities
- defined through different inter frame spaces (IFS)
- no guaranteed, hard priorities
- SIFS (Short IFS)
  - Highest priority, for ACK, CTS, polling response
- PIFS (PCS IFS)
  - medium priority, for time-bounded service using PCF (point coordination function)
- DIFS (DCF IFS)
  - Lowest priority, for asynchronous data service
** Wireless MAC
- Distributed and centralized MAC components
  - DCF
    - CSMA/CA (carrier sense multiple access collision avoidance) protocol
    - Suitable for multi-hop ad hoc networking
  - PCF
- Inter-frame spacing: SIFS and DIFS
*** Traffic services
- Asynchronous data service: support of broadcast and multicast, exchange on
  "best-effort"
- Time bounded service (optional): implemented using PCF
*** Access methods
- 802.11-DCF CSMA/CA
  - Collision avoidance with randomized back-off mechanism
  - Minimum distance between consecutive packets
  - ACK packet for acknoledgements (not for broadcasts)
  - RTS/CTS (optional): avoid hidden terminal problem
  - PCF (optional): access point polls terminals according to a list
    - should guarantee a maximum access delay
  - Beacon can be used for time synchronization
** DCF
- Uses RTS-CTS to avoid hidden terminal problem
  - Any overhearing of either packet causes that node to stay quiet for duration
    of the dialog
- Uses ACK for reliability
  - For the duration of data, other nodes stay quiet to avoid interference
    during ACK
** Unicast Packets
- Station waits for DIFS before sending
- Receiver waits
- If station does not receive Ack, retransmits after sizeof(data) + SIFS + ACK +
  DIFS time
** Fragmentation
- Wait SIFS after CTS,
- Transmit fragment,
- Wait SIFS,
- Receive Ack,
- Wait SIFS,
- Send Fragment 2, and repeat
