***** 1794, optical telgraph, Claude Chappe
**** Electromagnetic waves are of special importance:
***** 1831 Faraday demonstrates electromagnetic induction
***** J Maxel (1831-79)
****** theory of electromagnetic fields, wave equations (1864)
***** H Hertz (1857-94)

***** 1915 Wireless voice trans mission new york to San Franciso
***** 1920 Discovery short waves by Marconi
****** reflection at the ionosphere
****** smaller sender and receiver due to vacuum tubes
******* The smaller the frequency the smaller you can make the antennas
******* However the higher you go in frequency (past optical), the more the communication becomes directional
******* The lower you go, the more omnidirectional the signal
***** Lots of development in cellular communication since then
***** 1992 Deployment of GSM
***** 2010 LTE standards mature, first trials
*** Wireless Systems
**** Cellphones
**** Satellites
**** Cordless phones
**** Wireless LANs
*** Applications of RF Communication
**** Limited spectrum must be shared among various applications
**** Spectrum access typically regulated by the government
***** All of the spectrum has been allocated
****** Our devices must on occassion switch frequencies
****** Software defined radios (SDR) sense multiple parts of the spectrum
******* They can communicate on the part of the spectrum that isn't used very well
******* At that point we are _secondary users_.
******* Once a _primary user_ begins communicating our device must relinquish the requency
*** Wired networks: Internet
**** History
***** 1969: First ARPANET deploted
***** 1974: RFC 675 - Specification of Internet Transmission Control Program
***** Early 1980s: TCP/IP deployed
***** Wireless links often at the "edge" of the internet
****** The dawn of wireless communication necessitated the rethinking of communication protocols to deal with this new unreliable medium
*** Communication Protocols
**** Layerted for simplity of design
**** 313 concepts on networking
*** Wireless Network Architectures
**** Infrastructure-based networks (IBN)
- Typically there is a backbone network
  - Can be a go-between for the client and the actual network
**** Infrastructure-less (ad hoc) networks
- The clients connect directly through one-another
- There is no backbone network
- The actual network is formed by the interconnections of all the clients
**** Hybrid networks
- There can be an ad hoc network ultimately connected to a infrastructure-based network
- In this case, the clients in the ad hoc network would have some indirect connection to the internet
  - If the internet in this case is a IBN
**** Wireless Protocols
- Many apps and challenging problems
  - significant research and development activity
- THis course provides an intro to some of these issues
** Protocols and Network Architectures
- *Protocol* a set of rules and conventions
- By enforcing that communicating parties adhere to common *protocol*,
  communication is possible
- A *Network Architecture* is a *structured set of protocols* that implement the
  exchange of information between computers
*** The Levels of Abstraction
- Multiple levels of communication abstractions have been defined by
  standardization bodies
- Each level is enforced by a corresponding protocol
- Each level uses the abstract services of the level below
- Abstraction achieves separation of concerns
  - A protocol needn't know how the lower-level abstractions are implemented and
    what the higher level asbtractions are
**** Layered Network Architecture
- In a *Layered Network Architecture*, the services are grouped in a hierarchy
  of layers.
  - A protocol at _layer N_ uses only services of _layer N-1_
  - A protocol at _layer_N_ provides services only to _layer N+1_
**** Service Primitives
- Assume that some protocol implements service 'X'.
- Recall: A layer N+1 protocol entity sees the lower layers only as an abstract
  service provider
- In the letter example, the letter is the primitive
- The protocol is the postal service
**** (Un-)Acknowledged Service
- A sender cannot assume that a message is received
- Without acknowledgement from the receiver, we have an unconfirmed service
*** Protocol Architectures
**** Few relevant protocols today
- OSI Reference Model
- TCP/IP Suite
- ATM Protocol Stack
**** OSI 
***** defines seven layers
A leaf node in a network may only need layers 1 to 3. But higher level nodes
typically utilize the whole stack.
****** 7: Application
- Provides network access to application programs
- Example: File transfer, Email
****** 6: Presentation
- Data conversion into application format
- Encryption/decryption
- Secure sockets
****** 5: Session
- Support the dialog between cooperating application programs
- Session management, synchronization
- Example: RPC
****** 4: Transport
- Controls delivery of data between hosts
- Connection management, error contro. flow control, multiplexing
- Example: TCP, UDP
****** 3: Network
- Moves packets inside the network
- Performs routing, addressing, switching, congestion control
- Example: IP
****** 2: Data Link
- Reliably transfers frames over a link
- Performs synchronization, error control, flow control
- Example: PPP
****** 1: Physical
- Converts bits into electrical or optical signal
- Transmits these signals over the hardware communication medium
- Example: RS-232
***** Layers and Encapsulation
- Higher level layers will pass on a header with some info down to lower layers
- The header, as it is passed down from higher level layers to lower level
  layers, typically accumulates more and more information as it is relevant to
  the layer beneath it
- Once you get to the physical layer, the header is interpreted as a sequence of bits
***** TCP/IP Suite
- The TCP/IP protocol suite was first defined in 1974
- The TCP/IP protocol suite is the protocol architecture of the *Internet*
- The TCP/IP suite has four layers:
  - Application
  - Transport,
  - Internet,
  - Network and Interface
**** Network Protocol Analysis
***** There are 3 methods to analyze network protocols
- Mathematical Analysis
- Network simulators
- Testbed
***** Examples of network simulators
  - ns-2
  - GloMoSim/QualNet
  - OpNet
- NetSim
***** GloMoSim
- (Global Mobile Information System Simulator)
- A scalable *simulation environment*
- Supports *Wired* and *Wireless* network
- *Layered* approach
- Standard *APIs*
- Parallel *discrete-event* simulation
****** Install and run
- =cp /home/chen/build.sh ./=
- then run =bash ./build.sh=
** The Wireless Link
*** Frequencies for Communication
- VHF (30 Mhz) to UHF (300 Mhz) comprises the mobile radio spectrum
- UHF (300 Mhz) to SHF (30 Ghz) comprises most the wireless LAN spectrum
**** Abbreviations
- VLF = Very Low Frequency
- MF = Medium Frequency
- VHF = Very High Frequency
- UHF = Ultra High Frequency
- SHF = Super High Frequency
- EHF = Extra High Frequency
- UV = Ultraviolet
**** Wireless Transmission
- Processing through the source, the channel, and finally at the receiver
  - Information Source, source encoder, channel encoder, modulator, channel,
    demodulator, channel decoder, source decoder, information sink
***** Transmitter
****** Packetization
- Bits obtained from source coding are divided into chunks (i.e. packets)
****** Encapsulation
- Adding headers by various network layers
****** Error Control Codes
- Errors may occur during transmission over the wireless channel
- Error control codes (ECC) can be used to detect and/or correct such errors
- Error control capabilities of a code depend on the redundancy introduced by
  the code
- (n, k) code: k bits of data, n-k checkbits
- ECC may not be able to correct or detect all errors
- Higher layers cannot rely on lower layers to detect/correct all errors
- Different protocol layers incorporate different ECC mechanisms, depending on
  the reliability requirements
- Ultimate responsibility for reliability at the application layer
- Error probability is a function of transmit power, which is constrained
- ECC incurs overhead, which reduces the effective data rate
- What is the best possible reliable rate? optimization problem
******* Hamming Distance
- *Code* = set of codewords
- *Hamming distance* between two codewords = number of bits in which they differ
- *Distance of a code* = minimum Hamming distance between two codewords
******** Examples
********* (7,4) Single Error Correcting (SEC) Code
  - The properties of the code allows the receiver to correct a single bad bit
  - Otherwise a decoding error (up to 2 bit errors), or an undetected error
  - May be used to detect up to 2 bit errors (but correct no errors)
    - More than 2 errors may not be detected
  - In general, the higher the redundancy, the higher the detecting
********* (8,4) Single Error Correcting-Double Error Detecting (SECDEC) error
- Correct single bit errors
- Detect 2 bit errors (can differentiate between 1 and 2 bit errors)
- More than 2 errors may result in decoding error or undetected error
- Code may be used to detect up to 3 bit errors (but correct no errors)
  - More than 3 errors may not be detected
****** Modulation
- Transmission must use appropriate band of spectrum
- Modulation can facilitate the use of appropriate band
******* Example
******** Binary pulse amplitude modulation (Binary PAM)
- Pulse b(t) of duration T
- Consider first bit
- *Baseband signal* _superimposed_ on the carrier
  - baseband is the signal you multiply -1 or 1 by to indicate whether you are
    transmitting a 1 or a 0 bit
    - typically you multiply by -1 to send 0 and 1 to send a 1
- Multiply the *baseband* signal by *carrier*
  - baseband is what you want to transmit, and the carrier is how you transmit it
- You obtain the modulated signal
******* Fourier Transform
- You can use it to *transform a signal in the frequency domain to the time*
  domain and vice versa
- It says that given a crazy curve representing a signal in the time domain, you
  can get all the different frequencies present by transforming it into the
  frequency domain using a fourier transform
******* Energy
- take the absolute of the time domain, square it, and integrate it from t1 to t2
- This yields the energy
******* Power
- Divide the energy by time, and take the limit of time as it approaches
  infinity (used when you are in the time domain)
- Conceptually, power is how much energy is available in a very short period of
  time
- *Power spectral density* measure of contribution of frequency f to power of
  signal x(t) (used when you are in the frequency domain)
******** Decibel Notation
- Power in *decibel watt/milliwatt* notation
- Power in dBW = 10logP
  - Where P is in watts?
- Power in dBm = 10logP
  - Where P is in milliwats
- Note log is in base 10
****** Propagation
- Is received signal identical with one sent?
******* Noise and Interference
- The signal received by the reciever is a composite of
  - Signal of interest
  - Noise
  - Interference (information of interest to some other receiver)
******** Noise Model
- Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) Process
  - See this slide for an example converting power to dBm
- Additive
  - Noise added to the signal of interest
- White
  - Noise power spectral density is flat, independent of f
- Process
  - Noise at each t is a random variable
- Gaussian
  - n(t) = noise at time t is a gaussian random variable
********* Receiver
********** Received signal
  - Assum single path from transmitter to reciever with ero delay
  - awgn channel with noise power spectral density $N_0/2$
    - $r(t) = aw_i(t) + n(t)$
********** Energy per Bit in Received Signal
********** Demodulation
- random stuff happens, and people are happy, because stuff just works
- Note: error probability goes up the lower the energy per bit
*********** Binary PAM
- Errors occur during transmission
- *Packet error probability* function of *bit error probability* and *packet size*
- Error probability can be reduced by increasing energy per bit
  - Higher transmision power and/or
  - Lower transmission rate
    - trade-off between transmission rate and error probability
- *Similar conclusions hold for other modulation schemes*
*********** Throughput Limit for a Wireless Link
- Performance of a traffic flow (depending on traffic):
  - Throughput 
  - Packet loss rate
  - Delay
  - Jitter
- Shannon (1940) introduced *channel capacity*:
  - *Best achievable rate of reliability information delivery*
  - Measured in Bits/sec
************ Channel capacity
- AWGN channel with bandwidth W
  - $C = W\log_2(1+P/(N_0W))$
    - It's different if there are 1 or more interferers
  - The P dib by N_0 imtes W is the signal to noise ratio
  - Capacity is in bits/sec (W is bandwith in Hz). P is received signal power
  - SNR in dB = 10log(signal power / noise power)
  - _THe higher SNR the more reliable the signal_
************ Transmission range
- Where does a link exist or break?
  - wherever it does
******** Channel Model
- Transmitted signal x(t)
- Received signal r(t)
  - $r(t) = \sum_ia_ix(t-\tau_i)+n(t)+i(t)$
********* Path Gain and Path Loss
- *Path gain* is ratio of received power and transmit power
- Path loss is 1 over path gain
- Path loss PL(db) = 10 log (path loss)
- Received power < transmit power
********* Path Loss Models
********** Large scale path loss:
  - Captures average channel conditions
*********** Free space propagation model
- Valid only for distances $d$ and $d_0$ such that $d \geq d_0$
  - $P_r(d) = P_r(d_0)d^2_0/d^2$
- Receieved power is proportial to the sending power and is inversely
  proportional to the square of the distance
- Received power $P_r = KP_s/d^2$
- $PL(d)=PL(d_0)+20\log(d/d_0)$
********** Small scale path loss:
  - Captures small scale variations due to fading
** Distributed Multiple Access Control
*** Medium Access Control
- Depends on
  - Channel properties
  - Physical capabilities
    - Single interace
    - One packet at a time
    - One channel at a time
    - Antenna diversity
- Here we assume single interface, single channel, single antenna, one packet at
  a time
*** Introduction
*** Medium Access Control Protocols
- *Assumption* Propagation delay small compared with transmission time
**** Archetypes
***** Centralized
    - A designated host is responsible for coordinating access
    - Not of immediate interest to us
***** Distributed
    - No single host responsible for access
**** Coordinated Access
- Each host is somehow "scheduled" to transmit in certain intervals of time
- Example: token ring
- Schedule between simultaneous transmissions
**** Random access
- Each host "randomly" decides when to transmit
**** Basic
- Based on Aloha
- Simple rule
  - Transmit packet immediately (if not transmitting another packet already)
  - "Unsynchronized time slots"
***** Shortcomings
- No provision for reliability
- No detection of "collisions"
***** Overcome with synchronized time slots
- Synchronized time slots as opposed to unsynchronized yields higher probability
  of successful transmission, about twice as higher.
- Probability of transmission for synchronized (n is how many slots, p is the
  probability that one slot will transmit)
  - $np(n-p)^{n-1}$
- Probability of transmission for unsynchronized (n is how many slots, p is the
  probability that one slot will transmit)
  - $np(n-p)^{2(n-1)}$
**** Carrier Sensing Multiple Access (CSMA)
- Listen-before-you-talk
- A host may transmit only if the channel is sensed as idle
***** Energy Detection
- A potential implementation
  - sample the signal periodically
  - sum the square of the sampled values
  - if sum exceeds threshold, signal present
- Requires non-zero delay to correctly sense the channel status
  - This incurs overhead
- *Another possibility* detect transition from idle to busy, and vice-versa,
  instead of presence of a signal.
****** Approximation
******* Carrier Sense (CS) threshold Pcs
- If *received power* < _CS threshold_ ==> CHANNEL IDLE
- Else CHANNEL BUSY
- Energy detection accuracy also affected by noise and interference
- Energy detection non-deterministic due to presence of noise
- The approximation assumes that if received signal exceeds Pcs, the
  transmission will always be sensed.
******** Impact of CS Thresold on Interference
- Setting the threshold lower results in lower interference
******* Feature Detection
- Detect a "well-known" waveform to know if a transmission is taking place
  - Preamble
- Trade-off between complexity and accuracy of sensing with energy  detection
- *Our discussion will assume the approximate characterization of energy
  detection*
******** Trade-off
- Large carrier sense threshold
  - More transmitters
  - Greater spatial reuse & more interference
- Trade-off between *spatial reuse* and *interference*
****** Hidden Terminals
- Hiding terminals from each other causes the terminals hidden from each other
  to activate the idle state of the other. This causes huge interference for
  nodes that aren't hidden from each other but are communicating with nodes
  which are may or may not be hidden from each other
