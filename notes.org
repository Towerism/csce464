** (Lecture 1) Wireless Communication and Mobility
*** Aspects of mobility
**** user mobility: users communicate "anytime, anywhere, with anyone"
**** device portability: devices can be connected anytime, anywhere to the netwokr
*** Wireless vs mobile
**** A desktop is neither
**** Notebook is not wireless, but is mobile
**** Smartphone is both
*** Need the integration of wireless networks or mobility mechanisms into existing fixed networks:
**** telephone network -> cellulary telephony (eg GSM)
**** LAN -> Wireless LANs (eg IEEE 802.11)
**** Internet -> Mobile IP
*** Wireless Enabled Devices
More and more devices are becoming wireless
**** Satellite communication
***** Only satellite communication has complete coverage across the worldi
***** GPS
**** Wireless "Last Mile": WiMAX
***** something something cell tower
**** Wireless sensors
***** Introduced in early 2000s
***** Really small embedded devices
***** Hardware
***** Headless operation after installing the software
****** Software is the OS, Firmware, Subroutines, all of it
***** Sensor networks: "Internet of things"
**** RFID
***** Tags
**** Medical Implants
***** Something something, saving lives
**** Vehicular communication
***** In the future, driverless cars
***** Communication with towers and other cars
****** e.g. propagating signal that an accident has occurred
****** Security issues?
****** Dedicated short-range communication (DSRC)
**** Software Defined Radio (SDR)
***** Emits a single signal at a single frequency
***** All logic is embedded in the hardware
****** Save energy
****** Save time
***** Application
****** Cognitive Radios -> Dynamic Spectrum Access
*** History of Wireless Communication
**** Many people in history used light for communication
***** heliographs, flags ("semaphore")
***** 150 BC smoke signals for communication (Greece)
***** 1794, optical telgraph, Claude Chappe
**** Electromagnetic waves are of special importance:
***** 1831 Faraday demonstrates electromagnetic induction
***** J Maxel (1831-79)
****** theory of electromagnetic fields, wave equations (1864)
***** H Hertz (1857-94)
****** Demonstrates with an experiment the wave character of electrical transmission through space (1886)
***** 1895 Guglielmo Marconi
****** First long wave transmission (infrared)
****** First wireless telegraph
***** 1907 Commercial transatlantic connections
****** huge base stations (30 to 100m high antennas)
***** 1915 Wireless voice trans mission new york to San Franciso
***** 1920 Discovery short waves by Marconi
****** reflection at the ionosphere
****** smaller sender and receiver due to vacuum tubes
******* The smaller the frequency the smaller you can make the antennas
******* However the higher you go in frequency (past optical), the more the communication becomes directional
******* The lower you go, the more omnidirectional the signal
***** Lots of development in cellular communication since then
***** 1992 Deployment of GSM
***** 2010 LTE standards mature, first trials
*** Wireless Systems
**** Cellphones
**** Satellites
**** Cordless phones
**** Wireless LANs
*** Applications of RF Communication
**** Limited spectrum must be shared among various applications
**** Spectrum access typically regulated by the government
***** All of the spectrum has been allocated
****** Our devices must on occassion switch frequencies
****** Software defined radios (SDR) sense multiple parts of the spectrum
******* They can communicate on the part of the spectrum that isn't used very well
******* At that point we are _secondary users_.
******* Once a _primary user_ begins communicating our device must relinquish the requency
*** Wired networks: Internet
**** History
***** 1969: First ARPANET deploted
***** 1974: RFC 675 - Specification of Internet Transmission Control Program
***** Early 1980s: TCP/IP deployed
***** Wireless links often at the "edge" of the internet
****** The dawn of wireless communication necessitated the rethinking of communication protocols to deal with this new unreliable medium
*** Communication Protocols
**** Layerted for simplity of design
**** 313 concepts on networking
*** Wireless Network Architectures
**** Infrastructure-based networks (IBN)
- Typically there is a backbone network
  - Can be a go-between for the client and the actual network
**** Infrastructure-less (ad hoc) networks
- The clients connect directly through one-another
- There is no backbone network
- The actual network is formed by the interconnections of all the clients
**** Hybrid networks
- There can be an ad hoc network ultimately connected to a infrastructure-based network
- In this case, the clients in the ad hoc network would have some indirect connection to the internet
  - If the internet in this case is a IBN
**** Wireless Protocols
- Many apps and challenging problems
  - significant research and development activity
- THis course provides an intro to some of these issues
