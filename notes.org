***** 1794, optical telgraph, Claude Chappe
**** Electromagnetic waves are of special importance:
***** 1831 Faraday demonstrates electromagnetic induction
***** J Maxel (1831-79)
****** theory of electromagnetic fields, wave equations (1864)
***** H Hertz (1857-94)
****** Demonstrates with an experiment the wave character of electrical transmission through space (1886)
***** 1895 Guglielmo Marconi

***** 1915 Wireless voice trans mission new york to San Franciso
***** 1920 Discovery short waves by Marconi
****** reflection at the ionosphere
****** smaller sender and receiver due to vacuum tubes
******* The smaller the frequency the smaller you can make the antennas
******* However the higher you go in frequency (past optical), the more the communication becomes directional
******* The lower you go, the more omnidirectional the signal
***** Lots of development in cellular communication since then
***** 1992 Deployment of GSM
***** 2010 LTE standards mature, first trials
*** Wireless Systems
**** Cellphones
**** Satellites
**** Cordless phones
**** Wireless LANs
*** Applications of RF Communication
**** Limited spectrum must be shared among various applications
**** Spectrum access typically regulated by the government
***** All of the spectrum has been allocated
****** Our devices must on occassion switch frequencies
****** Software defined radios (SDR) sense multiple parts of the spectrum
******* They can communicate on the part of the spectrum that isn't used very well
******* At that point we are _secondary users_.
******* Once a _primary user_ begins communicating our device must relinquish the requency
*** Wired networks: Internet
**** History
***** 1969: First ARPANET deploted
***** 1974: RFC 675 - Specification of Internet Transmission Control Program
***** Early 1980s: TCP/IP deployed
***** Wireless links often at the "edge" of the internet
****** The dawn of wireless communication necessitated the rethinking of communication protocols to deal with this new unreliable medium
*** Communication Protocols
**** Layerted for simplity of design
**** 313 concepts on networking
*** Wireless Network Architectures
**** Infrastructure-based networks (IBN)
- Typically there is a backbone network
  - Can be a go-between for the client and the actual network
**** Infrastructure-less (ad hoc) networks
- The clients connect directly through one-another
- There is no backbone network
- The actual network is formed by the interconnections of all the clients
**** Hybrid networks
- There can be an ad hoc network ultimately connected to a infrastructure-based network
- In this case, the clients in the ad hoc network would have some indirect connection to the internet
  - If the internet in this case is a IBN
**** Wireless Protocols
- Many apps and challenging problems
  - significant research and development activity
- THis course provides an intro to some of these issues
** Protocols and Network Architectures
- *Protocol* a set of rules and conventions
- By enforcing that communicating parties adhere to common *protocol*,
  communication is possible
- A *Network Architecture* is a *structured set of protocols* that implement the
  exchange of information between computers
*** The Levels of Abstraction
- Multiple levels of communication abstractions have been defined by
  standardization bodies
- Each level is enforced by a corresponding protocol
- Each level uses the abstract services of the level below
- Abstraction achieves separation of concerns
  - A protocol needn't know how the lower-level abstractions are implemented and
    what the higher level asbtractions are
**** Layered Network Architecture
- In a *Layered Network Architecture*, the services are grouped in a hierarchy
  of layers.
  - A protocol at _layer N_ uses only services of _layer N-1_
  - A protocol at _layer_N_ provides services only to _layer N+1_
**** Service Primitives
- Assume that some protocol implements service 'X'.
- Recall: A layer N+1 protocol entity sees the lower layers only as an abstract
  service provider
- In the letter example, the letter is the primitive
- The protocol is the postal service
**** (Un-)Acknowledged Service
- A sender cannot assume that a message is received
- Without acknowledgement from the receiver, we have an unconfirmed service
*** Protocol Architectures
**** Few relevant protocols today
- OSI Reference Model
- TCP/IP Suite
- ATM Protocol Stack
**** OSI 
***** defines seven layers
A leaf node in a network may only need layers 1 to 3. But higher level nodes
typically utilize the whole stack.
****** 7: Application
- Provides network access to application programs
- Example: File transfer, Email
****** 6: Presentation
- Data conversion into application format
- Encryption/decryption
- Secure sockets
****** 5: Session
- Support the dialog between cooperating application programs
- Session management, synchronization
- Example: RPC
****** 4: Transport
- Controls delivery of data between hosts
- Connection management, error contro. flow control, multiplexing
- Example: TCP, UDP
****** 3: Network
- Moves packets inside the network
- Performs routing, addressing, switching, congestion control
- Example: IP
****** 2: Data Link
- Reliably transfers frames over a link
- Performs synchronization, error control, flow control
- Example: PPP
****** 1: Physical
- Converts bits into electrical or optical signal
- Transmits these signals over the hardware communication medium
- Example: RS-232
***** Layers and Encapsulation
- Higher level layers will pass on a header with some info down to lower layers
- The header, as it is passed down from higher level layers to lower level
  layers, typically accumulates more and more information as it is relevant to
  the layer beneath it
- Once you get to the physical layer, the header is interpreted as a sequence of bits
***** TCP/IP Suite
- The TCP/IP protocol suite was first defined in 1974
- The TCP/IP protocol suite is the protocol architecture of the *Internet*
- The TCP/IP suite has four layers:
  - Application
  - Transport,
  - Internet,
  - Network and Interface
**** Network Protocol Analysis
***** There are 3 methods to analyze network protocols
- Mathematical Analysis
- Network simulators
- Testbed
***** Examples of network simulators
  - ns-2
  - GloMoSim/QualNet
  - OpNet
- NetSim
***** GloMoSim
- (Global Mobile Information System Simulator)
- A scalable *simulation environment*
- Supports *Wired* and *Wireless* network
- *Layered* approach
- Standard *APIs*
- Parallel *discrete-event* simulation
****** Install and run
- =cp /home/chen/build.sh ./=
- then run =bash ./build.sh=
** The Wireless Link
*** Frequencies for Communication
- VHF (30 Mhz) to UHF (300 Mhz) comprises the mobile radio spectrum
- UHF (300 Mhz) to SHF (30 Ghz) comprises most the wireless LAN spectrum
**** Abbreviations
- VLF = Very Low Frequency
- MF = Medium Frequency
- VHF = Very High Frequency
- UHF = Ultra High Frequency
- SHF = Super High Frequency
- EHF = Extra High Frequency
- UV = Ultraviolet
*** Wireless Transmission
- Processing through the source, the channel, and finally at the receiver
  - Information Source, source encoder, channel encoder, modulator, channel,
    demodulator, channel decoder, source decoder, information sink
**** Packetization
- Bits obtained from source coding are divided into chunks (i.e. packets)
**** Encapsulation
- Adding headers by various network layers
**** Error Control Codes
- Errors may occur during transmission over the wireless channel
- Error control codes (ECC) can be used to detect and/or correct such errors
- Error control capabilities of a code depend on the redundancy introduced by
  the code
- (n, k) code: k bits of data, n-k checkbits
- ECC may not be able to correct or detect all errors
- Higher layers cannot rely on lower layers to detect/correct all errors
- Different protocol layers incorporate different ECC mechanisms, depending on
  the reliability requirements
- Ultimate responsibility for reliability at the application layer
- Error probability is a function of transmit power, which is constrained
- ECC incurs overhead, which reduces the effective data rate
- What is the best possible reliable rate? optimization problem
***** Hamming Distance
- *Code* = set of codewords
- *Hamming distance* between two codewords = number of bits in which they differ
- *Distance of a code* = minimum Hamming distance between two codewords
****** Examples
******* (7,4) Single Error Correcting (SEC) Code
  - The properties of the code allows the receiver to correct a single bad bit
  - Otherwise a decoding error (up to 2 bit errors), or an undetected error
  - May be used to detect up to 2 bit errors (but correct no errors)
    - More than 2 errors may not be detected
  - In general, the higher the redundancy, the higher the detecting
******* (8,4) Single Error Correcting-Double Error Detecting (SECDEC) error
- Correct single bit errors
- Detect 2 bit errors (can differentiate between 1 and 2 bit errors)
- More than 2 errors may result in decoding error or undetected error
- Code may be used to detect up to 3 bit errors (but correct no errors)
  - More than 3 errors may not be detected
**** Modulation
- Transmission must use appropriate band of spectrum
- Modulation can facilitate the use of appropriate band
***** Example
****** Binary pulse amplitude modulation (Binary PAM)
- Pulse b(t) of duration T
- Consider first bit
- *Baseband signal* _superimposed_ on the carrier
  - baseband is the signal you multiply -1 or 1 by to indicate whether you are
    transmitting a 1 or a 0 bit
    - typically you multiply by -1 to send 0 and 1 to send a 1
- Multiply the *baseband* signal by *carrier*
  - baseband is what you want to transmit, and the carrier is how you transmit it
- You obtain the modulated signal
****** Fourier Transform
- You can use it to transform a signal in the frequency domain to the time
  domain and vice versa
- It says that given a crazy curve representing a signal in the time domain, you
  can get all the different frequencies present by transforming it into the
  frequency domain using a fourier transform
