**** device portability: devices can be connected anytime, anywhere to the netwokr
*** Wireless vs mobile
**** A desktop is neither
**** Notebook is not wireless, but is mobile
**** Smartphone is both
*** Need the integration of wireless networks or mobility mechanisms into existing fixed networks:
**** telephone network -> cellulary telephony (eg GSM)
**** LAN -> Wireless LANs (eg IEEE 802.11)
**** Internet -> Mobile IP

***** All logic is embedded in the hardware
****** Save energy
****** Save time
***** Application
****** Cognitive Radios -> Dynamic Spectrum Access
*** History of Wireless Communication
**** Many people in history used light for communication
***** heliographs, flags ("semaphore")
***** 150 BC smoke signals for communication (Greece)
***** 1794, optical telgraph, Claude Chappe
**** Electromagnetic waves are of special importance:
***** 1831 Faraday demonstrates electromagnetic induction
***** J Maxel (1831-79)
****** theory of electromagnetic fields, wave equations (1864)
***** H Hertz (1857-94)
****** Demonstrates with an experiment the wave character of electrical transmission through space (1886)
***** 1895 Guglielmo Marconi
****** First long wave transmission (infrared)
****** First wireless telegraph
***** 1907 Commercial transatlantic connections
****** huge base stations (30 to 100m high antennas)
***** 1915 Wireless voice trans mission new york to San Franciso
***** 1920 Discovery short waves by Marconi
****** reflection at the ionosphere
****** smaller sender and receiver due to vacuum tubes
******* The smaller the frequency the smaller you can make the antennas
******* However the higher you go in frequency (past optical), the more the communication becomes directional
******* The lower you go, the more omnidirectional the signal
***** Lots of development in cellular communication since then
***** 1992 Deployment of GSM
***** 2010 LTE standards mature, first trials
*** Wireless Systems
**** Cellphones
**** Satellites
**** Cordless phones
**** Wireless LANs
*** Applications of RF Communication
**** Limited spectrum must be shared among various applications
**** Spectrum access typically regulated by the government
***** All of the spectrum has been allocated
****** Our devices must on occassion switch frequencies
****** Software defined radios (SDR) sense multiple parts of the spectrum
******* They can communicate on the part of the spectrum that isn't used very well
******* At that point we are _secondary users_.
******* Once a _primary user_ begins communicating our device must relinquish the requency
*** Wired networks: Internet
**** History
***** 1969: First ARPANET deploted
***** 1974: RFC 675 - Specification of Internet Transmission Control Program
***** Early 1980s: TCP/IP deployed
***** Wireless links often at the "edge" of the internet
****** The dawn of wireless communication necessitated the rethinking of communication protocols to deal with this new unreliable medium
*** Communication Protocols
**** Layerted for simplity of design
**** 313 concepts on networking
*** Wireless Network Architectures
**** Infrastructure-based networks (IBN)
- Typically there is a backbone network
  - Can be a go-between for the client and the actual network
**** Infrastructure-less (ad hoc) networks
- The clients connect directly through one-another
- There is no backbone network
- The actual network is formed by the interconnections of all the clients
**** Hybrid networks
- There can be an ad hoc network ultimately connected to a infrastructure-based network
- In this case, the clients in the ad hoc network would have some indirect connection to the internet
  - If the internet in this case is a IBN
**** Wireless Protocols
- Many apps and challenging problems
  - significant research and development activity
- THis course provides an intro to some of these issues
** Protocols and Network Architectures
- *Protocol* a set of rules and conventions
- By enforcing that communicating parties adhere to common *protocol*,
  communication is possible
- A *Network Architecture* is a *structured set of protocols* that implement the
  exchange of information between computers
*** The Levels of Abstraction
- Multiple levels of communication abstractions have been defined by
  standardization bodies
- Each level is enforced by a corresponding protocol
- Each level uses the abstract services of the level below
- Abstraction achieves separation of concerns
  - A protocol needn't know how the lower-level abstractions are implemented and
    what the higher level asbtractions are
**** Layered Network Architecture
- In a *Layered Network Architecture*, the services are grouped in a hierarchy
  of layers.
  - A protocol at _layer N_ uses only services of _layer N-1_
  - A protocol at _layer_N_ provides services only to _layer N+1_
**** Service Primitives
- Assume that some protocol implements service 'X'.
- Recall: A layer N+1 protocol entity sees the lower layers only as an abstract
  service provider
- In the letter example, the letter is the primitive
- The protocol is the postal service
**** (Un-)Acknowledged Service
- A sender cannot assume that a message is received
- Without acknowledgement from the receiver, we have an unconfirmed service
*** Protocol Architectures
**** Few relevant protocols today
- OSI Reference Model
- TCP/IP Suite
- ATM Protocol Stack
**** OSI 
***** defines seven layers
A leaf node in a network may only need layers 1 to 3. But higher level nodes
typically utilize the whole stack.
****** 7: Application
- Provides network access to application programs
- Example: File transfer, Email
****** 6: Presentation
- Data conversion into application format
- Encryption/decryption
- Secure sockets
****** 5: Session
- Support the dialog between cooperating application programs
- Session management, synchronization
- Example: RPC
****** 4: Transport
- Controls delivery of data between hosts
- Connection management, error contro. flow control, multiplexing
- Example: TCP, UDP
****** 3: Network
- Moves packets inside the network
- Performs routing, addressing, switching, congestion control
- Example: IP
****** 2: Data Link
- Reliably transfers frames over a link
- Performs synchronization, error control, flow control
- Example: PPP
****** 1: Physical
- Converts bits into electrical or optical signal
- Transmits these signals over the hardware communication medium
- Example: RS-232
***** Layers and Encapsulation
- Higher level layers will pass on a header with some info down to lower layers
- The header, as it is passed down from higher level layers to lower level
  layers, typically accumulates more and more information as it is relevant to
  the layer beneath it
- Once you get to the physical layer, the header is interpreted as a sequence of bits
***** TCP/IP Suite
- The TCP/IP protocol suite was first defined in 1974
- The TCP/IP protocol suite is the protocol architecture of the *Internet*
- The TCP/IP suite has four layers:
  - Application
  - Transport,
  - Internet,
  - Network and Interface
**** Network Protocol Analysis
***** There are 3 methods to analyze network protocols
- Mathematical Analysis
- Network simulators
- Testbed
***** Examples of network simulators
  - ns-2
  - GloMoSim/QualNet
  - OpNet
- NetSim
***** GloMoSim
- (Global Mobile Information System Simulator)
- A scalable *simulation environment*
- Supports *Wired* and *Wireless* network
- *Layered* approach
- Standard *APIs*
- Parallel *discrete-event* simulation
